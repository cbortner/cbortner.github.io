In my research, I am interested in applications of theoretical mathematics, including graph theory, combinatorics, and algebraic geoemtry, to problems from biology and physics.  Often this work is categorized as being in the field of <i>algebraic statistics</i>.  I love this work because it allows me to use several different areas of math while also having underlying motivation from the real world for the problems that I work on.  Almost every project I do involves some amount of code for testing examples in Python/Sage, Mathematica, Julia, and/or Macaulay2.

I take research students with varying backgrounds to work on different types of projects, ranging from code-heavy projects where we test different model characteristics, to theoretical projects where we prove things using graph theory, combinatorics, and algebra.  If you're interested in my work please email me!
