excerpt: 'Log-linear exponential random graph models are a specific class of statistical network models that have a log-linear representation. This class includes many stochastic blockmodel variants. In this paper, we focus on β-stochastic blockmodels, which combine the $\beta$-model with a stochastic blockmodel. Here, using recent results by Almendra-Hernandez, De Loera, and Petrovic, which describe a Markov basis for β-stochastic block model, we give a closed form formula for the maximum likelihood degree of a β-stochastic blockmodel. The maximum likelihood degree is the number of complex solutions to the likelihood equations.  In the case of the β-stochastic blockmodel, the maximum likelihood degree factors into a product of Eulerian numbers.'
